# Plant_Gen
Evolutionary Plant Traits Prediction Algorithm
This code predicts a new plant species based on traits like height, leaf area, and seed mass using data from an existing Tasmanian plant dataset. It defines a "fitness function" that favors plant traits like a height of 15 meters, leaf area around 10 cmÂ², and seed mass around 0.01 g. The algorithm then generates new traits by applying slight random variations to the traits of existing species. Through backtracking, it recursively tries to find a new species with higher fitness. If no suitable species is found after a set number of attempts, it stops.
